Temperature sensor with Tiva launchpad
======================================

This is a small temperature sensor application for Texas Instruments Tiva Launchpad board.
It reads temperatures from DS1820 chips and transmits results with
UDP packets to network.

It also includes a simple Web server based on picoos-net 
socket layer which provides a nice user interface for
web browsers.

For additional details see [this blog entry][1].
