Temperature sensor with Olimex LPC-E2129
=======================================

This is a small temperature sensor application for Olimex LPC-E2129 board.
It reads temperatures from DS1820 chips and transmits results with
UDP packets to network.

It also includes a simple Web server based on picoos-net 
socket layer which provides a nice user interface for
web browsers.
